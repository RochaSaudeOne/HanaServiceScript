User-defined table (UDT) and user-defined field (UDF) related issues often have different impacts. For instance, you may not be able to perform an upgrade of the database or you may receive the following error message after logging on to an SAP Business One database: "The database structure has been modified. In order to resume the process, all open windows will be closed. Do you want to continue adding the user-defined field?"

This note provides a few generic queries to detect some common issues about UDTs and UDFs. If an issue is related to a UDT and UDF, the queries provided below will detect the known inconsistencies.

UDT is defined but does not exist.
UDT is not registered.
UDF is defined on an unregistered UDT.
UDF is defined but does not exist.
UDF valid values are defined for a non-existing UDF.
UDF definition does not match actuality.
UDF/UDT contains extra spaces.
UDF contains extra spaces in the TableID field in User-fields description in the CUFD table.
UDF contains extra spaces in the AliasID field in User-fields description in the CUFD table.
UDF column  with space characters in its name was found by the SAP Business One upgrade Wizard.
UDT with space characters in its name was found by the SAP Business One upgrade Wizard.
UDF exists but is not defined in the CUFD table.
UDT exists with the name '@'.

Note for Points 2 and 8: The result set includes columns created both on SAP Business One system tables and user tables.
However, only columns created on SAP Business One tables should be considered, as those are potentially harmful.
A list of SAP Business One system tables is not available as it may differ from patch to patch.

Note for Point 4: After running the fix for Point 4, please run the detect query for Point 5 also and run the relevant fix if the detect query returns any result.

Note: Issue related to point 1,3,4,5,7a and 7b will be fixed after upgrading the database to SAP Business One 9.3 PL 10, check the SAP Note  2727525 - Auto-fixes for Upgrade UDT / UDF Related Issues for more detail.

Note: Issue related to point 9 will be fixed after upgrading the database to SAP Business one 9.3 PL 09, check the SAP Note 2732587 - Upgrade Wizard Error Precheck: Detect User Defined Value Linked to a Table Without a Name
